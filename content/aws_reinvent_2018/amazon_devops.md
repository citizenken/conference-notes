* 50 million deploys/year
* tools start to dictate behavior
* cultural philosphy
    * how often do we want to interact with our customers

timeline

* 2001 amazon was a monolith
* monolith had a lot of interdependencies
* went back and isolated independent units
    * cart
    * stock
    * labeling
* each unit gets 2 pizza teams
* after breaking up the units, agile was easier
* creating a multi-displinary team is NOT devops
    * each team member should have multiple skills, with fullstack ownership
    * learn new things, compliment team
* everything is code, so everything can be tested
* guardrails for self-service <-- key idea
    * opinionated templates
    * helps bootstrap quickly without falling off the cliff
